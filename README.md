# Toll Parking API

The document aims at describing the Toll Parking API create by `Fabio SPIGA`.

Through Toll Parking API, an end user can search for the most convenient parking lot for its own car, drive to it and park. 
At the moment of leaving, the API allows to compute the amount to pay and provide a bill to the user.

Toll Parking RESTful API is based on `OpenAPI Specification` (OAS) and uses `Swagger` tools to generate and visualize API documentation 
so it can be easily understood and used.

You can learn more about *why* using OpenAPI/Swagger from here: [https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.




## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Java JDK 8 - [Download & Install JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/index.html)
* Maven - [Download & Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)




## Downloading Toll Parking API

There are several ways you can get the Toll Parking API installed:

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get the Toll Parking project is to use git to directly clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spaiga/toll-parking.git toll-parking
```

This will clone the latest version of the toll-parking repository to a **toll-parking** folder.

### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to get the Toll Parking project is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/spaiga/toll-parking/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using the `wget` command:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/spaiga/toll-parking/archive/master.zip -O toll-parking.zip; unzip toll-parking.zip; rm toll-parking.zip
```




## Running Toll Parking API

The Toll Parking API server is generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  

In this example, the server uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

As a general rule, what is under the package `io.swagger` comes from the generated code, whereas the package `com.spiga` is written manually.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then view the swagger listing here:

[http://localhost:8080/api/swagger.json](http://localhost:8080/api/swagger.json)

The API Documentation is available here:

[http://localhost:8080/toll-parking-api-spec/](http://localhost:8080/toll-parking-api-spec/)


## Interacting with Toll Parking API

The server comes with a prefilled configuration (stored in-memory, as example) of:
* 12 parking lots;
* 2 pricing policies (one linear and one with fixed cost).

Several ways are available to interact with the server.

### Using the API Documentation

The [API Documentation](http://localhost:8080/toll-parking-api-spec/) allows also to interact with the API.

Clicking on each method, you will have the possibility to *Try it out* that method, directly from the web page.


### Using CURL

As an example, you can get all the available lots using the following CURL:
```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/lots?status=available" -H  "accept: application/json"
```

### Using the Java Client

The Toll Parking API client is a simple Java client generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate other client stubs.  

As a general rule, what is under the package `io.swagger` comes from the generated code, whereas the package `com.spiga` is written manually.

More details about the client [here](java-client/README.md).

### Unit Test
The Java Client is provided with a JUnit class (`java-client\src\test\java\com\spiga\api\client\TestParkingApi.java`) in order 
to automatically test the main functionalities and avoid to break them when developing.



## Generating Clients
We can automatically generate server stubs and client SDKs using [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).

Even easier, simply import the file 
```
jaxrs-server\src\main\webapp\toll-parking-api-spec\toll_parking_api.yml
```
into [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/)
and click on `Generate Client`.
